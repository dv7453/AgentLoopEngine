Minimal Async Workflow Engine (FastAPI)

A small, clean workflow/graph engine inspired by LangGraph.
Nodes are async Python functions operating on a shared WorkflowState.
A GraphDefinition defines how nodes connect, including branching and simple looping.

🚀 Features

Async nodes with typed shared state

Simple branching via named conditions

Looping until a condition is met

Per-node execution logs

In-memory storage (no database required)

FastAPI endpoints to create, run, and inspect workflows

🧩 Architecture Overview

engine/models.py

Pydantic models:
WorkflowState, GraphDefinition, RunContext, EdgeDef, BranchCondition

engine/registry.py

Node registry

Condition registry

Simple ToolRegistry

engine/runner.py

Async workflow runner

Sequential execution

Branch evaluation

Looping + max iteration safety

Per-step logging

store/memory_store.py

In-memory dictionaries for graphs and run contexts

api/routes.py

/graph/create

/graph/run

/graph/state/{run_id}

workflows/code_review.py

Example Code Review Mini-Agent workflow

▶️ Running the Project
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic requests

uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Health check:

GET http://localhost:8000/

📌 API Usage
1) Create a graph
POST /graph/create
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "graph_id": "code_review_graph",
  "start_node": "extract_functions",
  "nodes": [
    "extract_functions",
    "check_complexity",
    "detect_issues",
    "suggest_improvements",
    "evaluate_quality"
  ],
  "edges": {
    "extract_functions": { "default_next": "check_complexity", "branches": [] },
    "check_complexity":  { "default_next": "detect_issues", "branches": [] },
    "detect_issues":      { "default_next": "suggest_improvements", "branches": [] },
    "suggest_improvements": { "default_next": "evaluate_quality", "branches": [] },
    "evaluate_quality": {
      "default_next": null,
      "branches": [
        { "condition": "quality_below_threshold", "target": "detect_issues" }
      ]
    }
  }
}


Response:

{ "graph_id": "<uuid>" }

2) Run a workflow
POST /graph/run

{
  "graph_id": "<uuid-from-create>",
  "state": {
    "data": {
      "code": "def foo():\n    pass\n\ndef bar(x):\n    return x",
      "quality_threshold": 75
    },
    "metadata": {}
  }
}


Response includes:

run_id

final_state

logs

status
(e.g., completed, failed, or stopped_max_iterations)

3) Inspect run state
GET /graph/state/{run_id}


Example response:

{
  "run_id": "...",
  "graph_id": "...",
  "current_node": "evaluate_quality",
  "iteration": 5,
  "logs": [ ... ],
  "status": "completed"
}


Note: final_state is only returned by /graph/run.

🧠 Example Workflow: Code Review Agent

Nodes executed:

extract_functions

check_complexity

detect_issues

suggest_improvements

evaluate_quality

Looping:

If quality_score < quality_threshold,
evaluate_quality → detect_issues repeats.

Condition:

quality_below_threshold

This demonstrates branching + looping clearly.

📊 Log & Graph Visualization (Optional Helpers)

Two standalone scripts are included:

visualize_graph.py

Generates a Graphviz .dot file representing the workflow.

Render with:

dot -Tpng workflow_graph.dot -o workflow_graph.png

visualize_logs.py

Takes the output of /graph/run.

Shows a table:

Iteration | Node | Event | Keys Changed


Computes differences between consecutive node states.

🔧 Possible Future Improvements

Persist graph/runs in a database

Structured logging

WebSocket live log streaming

Per-node timeouts / cancellation

Node input/output schemas
